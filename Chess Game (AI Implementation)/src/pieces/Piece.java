 * The abstract class Piece holds a bunch of methods that help keep track of pieces on the board.
 * It has a number of methods for getting the location of pieces, what square pieces are on, for
 * checking if a point designated by pixels on the GUI corresponds to the piece, and checking the 
 * type of the piece (an abstract method).  The Piece also has a boolean color, for which black is true
 * and white is false.  
 * 
 * Note: the x,y location of each piece is designated in pixels, where (x,y) is the top left-hand corner 
 * of the piece.

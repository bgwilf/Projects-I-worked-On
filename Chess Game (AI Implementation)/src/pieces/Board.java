/**
 * The board class keeps track of what pieces are on what square.  The board class 
 * has a number of methods for checking if a square has a piece, for getting the piece
 * on a particular square, and for setting pieces on squares.  The constructor constructs
 * a board object with a number of arbitrary pieces. A second constructor allows a board
 * to be constructed from an existing board object.
 * 
 *  private board is a  2D ArrayList used to keep track of the
 *  pieces on each board.  Every square with no piece is represented with a null object,
 *  while squares with pieces contain the piece

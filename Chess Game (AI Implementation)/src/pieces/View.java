/**
 * The View class is a JComponent that can be added to JFrames. It has a 
 * board object, which keeps track of what pieces are on which square.
 * It then uses this board object to draw pieces on the board on squares
 * that do have pieces.  The View class, in it's constructor, adds
 * ActionListeners to itself that help in moving pieces around the board.
 * 
 * The View class also has a JTextArea textBox which is constantly updated
 * when pieces are moved on the board.  While the JTextArea is not put on
 * the View JComponent, the ActionListeners inside this view class update teh 
 * text field.  
 * 
 * Note that false designates white color and true designates black color on the 
 * board.  The human player is always white and the AI is always black when the 
 * game is played in an AI mode.
 * 
 * The Point mousePoint is used to keep track of where the cursor is when
 * someone is dragging a piece on the board.

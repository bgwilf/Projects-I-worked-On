1-Create a view "secondview" which shows all employees who have an empno less than 5. In order to get a mark for this you must finish the queries with "select * from secondview".
drop view secondview;
create view secondview as 
select empno from employee where empno < 5;
select * from secondview;

2-create a view which lists the number of courses each empno has been on, and confirm 
this as being correct by executing "select * from viewname" on it as the last select 
command of your SQL.
